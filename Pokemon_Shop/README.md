## Setting Up Your Scene
In order to start, please download and import the [skeleton package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dfWnvE7orxTojZJ7phKna36nYpdVWnZr/view?usp=sharing) into your own Unity 2D project.

## The Scenes
The [skeleton package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dfWnvE7orxTojZJ7phKna36nYpdVWnZr/view?usp=sharing) includes all the assets needed for the Shop scene (and a completed version of the previous week's Overworld Scene) and has things set up so that we can add scripts to make it playable. Before we get into that though, we want to go over what is in the scene. 

The Shop scene should look like this:


## Initial Scripts
We have provided some initial scripts that we will be using in this project. These scripts are not too long, so we don't want to spend a long time going over them, but we will provide a brief description of what they do.

## Setting Up A Shop Scene

## Subtracting Coins and Updating Quantity

## Connecting Everything Together


## Last Notes
This project is pretty experimental, so if anything seems off please send a message in our discord's `#questions` channel. It's also an extremely downscaled version of a normal turn-based combat game so that we could quickly explain the fundamentals of turn-based combat instead of making our own fleshed out game (which could take very long).
