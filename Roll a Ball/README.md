## Setting up a scene:
Start Unity Hub and click on **Projects** on the sidebar. Click on Add and select the folder named Roll a Ball to add Unity to your list of projects. If the project is greyed out then make sure that you have selected Unity 2020.3.15f2 as your project version.

There are several different Windows that should be visible by default. Here is a brief description of them.
 
**Hierarchy**: Displays every GameObject in a Scene. You can add GameObjects by right clicking on this window and selecting a type of GameObject. You can also search for specific GameObjects using the search bar above.<br>
 
**Scene**: The Scene view is what you can use to interact with GameObjects in the scene, such as cameras, lights, etc. Left-clicking on a GameObject in the Scene view will display its position and orientation in the world. The inspector will also be updated to display information about the object, unless it is locked.
 
**Game**: The Game view is rendered from the Camera’s(s) starting position. When you enter *Play Mode* by clicking on the play button at the top middle of the Unity Window, you’ll be able to see how your game plays. You can still make changes while in *Play Mode*, but the changes are temporary.
 
**Inspector**: Shows information about a specific GameObject, such as its name, transform, and any components that are attached to it. You can have the inspector remain fixed by clicking the lock icon at the top right.
 
**Project**: A file structure that allows you to search where assets, prefabs, and scripts are located in the project. You can move items to different folders by dragging and placing them in other folders. You can also attach some items like scripts to a GameObject by 
 
**Console**: Displays warnings, errors, other messages generated by Unity. This view is very useful when reading ```Debug``` messages.
