# Studio Beginner Tutorials - Winter 2022
## Welcome to the Beginner Track!
Unity is a powerful cross-platform game engine that's also great for getting started with game development. Many popular games you may have played, including *Pokémon Go*, *Hearthstone*, *Ori*, and *Escape from Tarkov*, were developed with Unity, but the engine also provides many tools for newcomers to learn with minimal coding.

In this four-part workshop series, you will be constructing a 2D RPG, similar to Pokemon! The goal of this series is to construct multiple systems from the ground up and connect them to establish a simple gameplay loop. Live workshops will take place on **Zoom (until in-person events are permitted) Tuesdays 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM PST**,  but if you can't attend, you can also watch edited recordings on our YouTube channel.

We are also offering [Advanced Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-advanced-tutorials-f21) and [Creative Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-creative-tutorials-f21) this quarter. The Advanced Track focuses on specfic programming concepts in game development, but we encourage you to check it out if you have prior coding experience, even if you haven't used Unity before. The Creative Track focuses on non-coding aspects of game development, such as animation, writing, and sound design, and is also open to newcomers learning Unity through our beginner track.

Additionally, if you'd like to get started with using version control with Unity, which is incredibly useful to know whether you're working alone or with a team, check out our [guide for using Unity with GitHub Desktop](./Using%20Unity%20with%20GitHub%20Desktop/README.md). 

*Note: If you are looking for tutorials taught in the fall, they can be found on the branch [fall-21](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21/tree/fall-21) of this repository.*
